paetch notes (7/3-7/4/2024):

-made sheet for RETRHO roster or RETRHOster, including list of observers, status (junior/senior), contact info in the form of emails, and checkmarks for which WGs they are in
-added contact page which will email the uf.retrho gmail when responses are submitted
-made it so application form also emails uf.retrho
-limited signup to 5 people per obs night (may be capped to 4 in future)
-updated form descriptions and auto emails of signup/followup for clarity in instructions
-added calendar functionality to signup process (https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=YzE4MGI4ZmMxNjkyM2FmMDczMmIyZDRhNDZhODc4YTkwNjZjNzhiY2Y2YjMwMjA2NmFjZDYzNmRlZjJkZTk3MkBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) 
-added sunset/sunrise functionality to google calendar based on date, *approximating* time of dusk and dawn for each month. so whenever you sign up to observe on a given night, the google calendar event will use those start/end times as approx. the amount of time to block off. this uses suggested sunrise/sunset dates (based on night and twilight values from timeanddate.com)
->had to account for daylight savings time my beloathed

8/1/2024
-minor change in auto target submission email to spacing
-implemented a way to choose from a list o calibration stars that will then tell you coords, rise and set times, V mag, and plot a finder chart (SO much fuckery went into this compared to what it would've been a few versions of astropy/astroquery/astroplan go, and im HIGHKEY mad abt it.)
-added calib stars Up functionality
->changed so they're listed by mag V brightness
->added altaz functionality

8/19/2024
-lots of manual editing and adding
-okay SO much manual shit lmaoooo. lord.

8/26/2024
-made mini manual on pre-check procedures
-fixed my stupid coordinates code which I Knew wasn't going to be good enough when I wrote it but didn't bother to fix it until now which was silly.
-priority/planning program: 
	-no longer has string silliness w/ coordinates (my fault, was lazy abt it)
	- no longer matters if simbad recognizes a name in tab 2 (uploaded spreadsheet tab), since coordinates are given in sheet (i.e., will default to coordinates if name does not return a result. this means it won't be able to give info on every object but Will be able to tell if it's up and can plot it)
	- have probably shot the efficiency to trash trying to work out other bugs but that's. fine. will work that out later lol
	- added Up functionality for uploaded target sheet objects

8/27/2024
-mini manual on pre-check procedures updated
-main manual updating w/ more up-to-date figures

9/4/2024

-added initial input csv file functionality (print)
-aforementioned print function will be called if simbad cant find an object-from-file name

-implemented filter of up status (show only up, show all targets)
-implemented Set Time functionality
-pretty-fied the print csv target info
-manual edits wrt notes
-a lot more bug fixes(?) and code efficiency(?) changes
-added Requirements determined by pipreqs
-so so so so so much debugging and edge testing

9/20/2024
-changed manual bit for manual astrometry to taking screenshots
-defined procedures for fixing target submission

9/23/2024
-made it so RA and dec are separate and Obvious
-maybe fixed still issue w/ stupid s's in cords which ifucken hate

-fixed bug relating to SIMBAD query on magnitude 
-fixed bug relating to uploading incorrect file
-aesthetic and readability updates, especially to tab2 (uploaded targets)
-scrollbar implemented
-fixed bug in altitude go vs print (NO idea what caused this. genuinely. like I know what it is but not how it happened, bc like. in the Go function where we invoke simbad, it prints with brackets that need to be cut off, but not if you use the CSV button????? idk. rly.)
-added setting/rising/circumpolar functionality
-added sorting for tab1 values and though tab2 was being a Bitch which is somewhat surprising considering it should be simpler to do, things are somewhat functional (but ofc new bugs have been introduced)
->go vs print submitted info bug (probs a Set Target issue)

10/2/2024

----------------------------------

priority/planning todo:
-eventually Algo pick best targets for a night
-star hop functionality

-checker to see ~where something is ??
-rising/falling in da code tm
-doesn't know what mizar is - ended up taking * zet01 UMa. idk if this is an issue for ME though or astropy??
-is observable or not functionality (constraints in astroplan)

-dark mode?

manual:
-star mag -> exposure time + filter(?)
-put darks/biases/flats/etc at BEGINNING of night to avoid humidity issues
-add sbig notifs are Normal
-add logout screenshot (bottom left lol)
-define procedures for fixing signup/followup/other forms(???) :thumbs_up:
